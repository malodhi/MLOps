Note:

Don't rely on the video tutorial for deploying your flask api on heroku.
For example you can't use the alternative of pip, conda, right now.
You can get all the help needed to understand how heroku works from the
official documentation:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/python-support

e.g you can't use conda instead of pip and can't name file any other then requirements.txt
to deploy your app on heroku.
